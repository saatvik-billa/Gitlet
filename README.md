# Gitlet
A project done in my Data Structures class at UC Berkeley during Spring 2022. We 
wrote everything from scratch and essentially recreated the Git version system, 
implementing many but not all of its features.

Because of UC Berkeley coursework rules, I am not allowed to publish the code for 
this publicly, so if you would like to see the project, please shoot me an email at 
svik724@berkeley.edu and I would love to send it to you!

Thank you!
